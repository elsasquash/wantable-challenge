# Hi Wantable!
Looking forward to partering with your team to create awesome solutions!

## About this challenge
- I spent about two hours tackling the basic requirements and a few of the bonus ones
- After lunch and feeding Luna :smile_cat:, I spent about an hour finishing up details and adding the Favorites feature using Context API

## About the tests
- There are unit tests for the service layer and a very basic UI test. This is where I drew the line because of the time constraints of the challenge, but I would have to add tests for the custom Hooks, and more tests for the UI.
- My usual approach is TDD for everything functional, especially when my goal is clear. For the UI, in cases where I have to be a bit creative, I might differ the testing, creating a basic view structure first to see if it suits my needs, and then adding more proper testing, and UI details. Like I said, because of the nature and time constraints of this challenge, UI testing was a bit lacking here.

### Looking forward to hearing from you!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
